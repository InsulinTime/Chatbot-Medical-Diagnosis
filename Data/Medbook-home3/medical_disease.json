It is characterized by symptoms like diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, and abdominal pain or cramps. While generally mild and self-limiting in healthy individuals, it can lead to complications like dehydration, especially in vulnerable populations like infants and older adults. Viral infections (like norovirus and rotavirus) are the most common cause, but bacterial infections (including food poisoning from contaminated food or water), parasites, and certain chemicals can also trigger gastroenteritis."
